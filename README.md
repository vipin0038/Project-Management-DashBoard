**Projects Assigned**: The pie chart shows the distribution of projects among eight project managers. Brendan Matthews has the largest share at 19%.

**Completion Status**: The central bar graph displays the completion rates for each manager, with Brendan Matthews leading at 95%.

**Overall Progress**: Two smaller bar graphs indicate that 63% of projects are complete, 11% are in process, and 26% have not started.

This dashboard helps in quickly assessing progress and workload distribution, making it easier to identify areas needing improvement or resource reallocation.
